## 1. Why Learn Security?
Modern systems and infrastructures are highly vulnerable.  
Malware means malicious software. 
Cyber threats include:

Malware means malicious software.
- Worms : Self-replicating malware that spreads through networks without user action.
- Viruses : Malicious code that attaches to legitimate programs and executes when the host runs.
- Trojan Horses : Program that looks harmless but secretly performs malicious operations.
- Spyware : Malware that secretly collects user activity or personal data without consent.
- Ransomware : Malware that locks or encrypts your files and then demands payment (a ransom) to unlock them.
---
- Botnets : Network of infected devices remotely controlled by an attacker.
---
- Phishing : Fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by impersonating trusted entities (often via email or fake websites). 
- Pharming : Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fake ones by exploiting DNS or host file manipulation.
- Phishing VS Pharming : 
    - Phishing = tricking people directly (social engineering). Example: fake email or website asking you to log in.

    - Pharming = technical redirection. The attacker changes DNS or host settings so you visit a fake site even if you type the correct URL.
---
- Identity Theft : Unauthorized use of another person’s personal data (e.g., SSN, credit card) to commit fraud or deception.
---
- Spam : Unsolicited bulk messages, usually advertisements, sent through email or messaging systems.
---

Due to historical weaknesses in system design, personal data and infrastructure remain more vulnerable than users realize.

Most computer systems were built for functionality, not security. Security was added later, not built-in.

## 2. Cybercrimes
Cybercrimes : crime that use digital as mediums.

Digital crimes include:
- **Cyber Stalking:** Harassment/Stalk others via online mediums.  
- **Fraud / Identity Theft:** Unauthorized use of personal info.  
- **Hacking:** Unauthorized access or.
---

## 3. Social Engineering
Persuading people into revealing confidential information.  
Example: AOL hack using fake car sale email with malware.  
Potential leaks include printed documents, disks, and outdated hardware.

## 4. Advertising & Scam
- Nigerian Scam : Help transfer large money, have to pay tax/fee first.

## 5. Botnets and DDoS
- **Botnet:** Network of compromised computers (bots).  
- **Uses:** Data theft, spam, phishing, DDoS.  
- DDoS : Distributed Denial of Service
    - IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an old text-based chat protocol.
    - Attackers use private IRC servers or channels to send commands to all infected machines (bots).

## 6. Man-in-the-middle
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Intercepting communications. (To monitor, to modify)  

Users are the **first line of defense**.

## 6. Ten Security Principles

| No. | Principle | Summary |
|-----|------------|----------|
| 1 | Least Privilege | Grant minimal access for minimal time. |
| 2 | Defense in Depth | Use multiple layers of protection. |
| 3 | Secure Failure | Systems should fail safely. |
| 4 | Secure the Weakest Link | A system is only as strong as its weakest part. |
| 5 | Compartmentalization | Isolate system components to limit damage. |
| 6 | Simplicity | Simple systems are easier to secure. |
| 7 | Promote Privacy | Protect user data diligently. |
| 8 | It's Hard to Hide Secrets | Avoid relying on obscurity. |
| 9 | Don’t Extend Trust Easily | Be skeptical of all systems, even internal ones. |
| 10 | Trust the Community | Rely on well-tested, reviewed public solutions. |

## 7. Definition of Security
- **Webopedia:** Ensuring data cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.  
- **Merriam-Webster:** Being “free from risk of loss.”  
- In computing: “Protection of resources from unauthorized access at any time.”

Security = **Who can do what when.**
